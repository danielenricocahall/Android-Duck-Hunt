# PPD_Final_Project
 This is an implementation of the class 1984 NES game Duck Hunt on Android by Daniel Cahall, Aaron Guidarelli, and Brian Westervelt. 
 In it, you will find really convoluted solutions to seemingly simple problems, and vice versa. 
 To run, just clone the repo and open in Android Studio. You should be able to run on the emulator or another connected (Android) device.
 Hindsight being 20/20, the game probably would have been written differently. That being said, it's probably not the worst architecture you've ever seen.
