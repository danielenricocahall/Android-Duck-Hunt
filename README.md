# Duck Hunt
This is an implementation of the class 1984 NES game Duck Hunt on Android by Daniel Cahall, Aaron Guidarelli, and Brian Westervelt. 
To run, just clone the repo and open in Android Studio. You should be able to run on the emulator or another connected (Android) device.

 ## TODO ##
 
 * Cleanup the sound functionality - that got a bit messy and I think uses a lot of unnecessary memory
 * Potentially refactor ducks to use Flyweight pattern (https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/flyweight-design-pattern/)
 * Refactor such that depending on the color, each duck has a slightly different movement pattern (https://gamefaqs.gamespot.com/nes/587252-duck-hunt/faqs/67372)
